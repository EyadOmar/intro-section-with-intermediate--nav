## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This my first time building modern nested dropdown lists, I did built the nested lists in JS and appended them onclicking and styled them as absolute elements. I don't know if It was the best approach but Its was good challnge.

### Continued development

I have big problem with my sidebar in small screens, when I open the sidebar, scoll happens when I press any link the scroll goes away. I tried to fix it But I couldn't so I will take a breather by building another website and I will return to it.
